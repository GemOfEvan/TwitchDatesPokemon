    "...oh yeah, I’m… I’m in the train."
    "Guess I fell asleep on the way here. Funny how moving can really tire you out."
    "The announcer's voice reminds me of my destination."
    "Twitch Academy."
    "Twitch Academy. Twitch. Academy."
    "I keep repeating the words in my head but it doesn't make it seem any more real."
    "Ever since I was a young Eevee, everyone spoke of how incredible a school it is."
    "The high standards, the prestigious teachers - and past students who went on to illustrious careers! -, everything a star school should have."
    "And now, as an Espeon, I will be one of those students!... Hopefully."
    "Heh. 'Espeon'... Even that is new to me. For the longest time I knew I wanted to be an Espeon. It was taking me forever to evolve. So many of my old teachers suggested I just be like all the other Eevees and use a stone to evolve, but... I finally did it."
    "I’m an Espeon. The Sun Pokémon. Symbol of a new day! And a new beginning!"
    "And now I’ll have a chance to prove myself at Twitch Academy."
    "I wonder what my classmates will be like... I just hope I can make some friends."
    "Of course, I'll still need to keep my grades up."
    "But I can't focus too much on study or I won't have any friends!"
    "B-but if I slack off too much, I'll have bad grades, which could get me expelled!"
    "Oh, Arceus, I also need to work on my schedule, and make sure tha-!"
